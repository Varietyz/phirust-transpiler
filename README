# PhiRust Transpiler

---

The `phicode-transpiler` is an optional binary and plugin designed to accelerate the PhiCode Runtime Engineâ€™s transpilation process by efficiently converting symbolic PhiCode syntax into Python code using preconfigured regex-based mappings. It integrates a `ThreatDetector` that leverages the Aho-Corasick algorithm to identify potentially dangerous Python constructs, such as `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, and unsafe built-ins, providing a security layer during transpilation. The transpiler supports high-performance bulk replacement of symbols, detects the presence of extended UTF-8 symbols before processing to optimize runtime, and allows optional bypass of security checks for trusted environments, making it a modular and extensible component of the PhiCode ecosystem.
